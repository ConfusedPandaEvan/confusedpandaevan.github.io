My Personal Website

This website is made for the 30MFF Communication Lab Course for NYUAD.

The video that I used is a part of a video I have filmed with my friends.
The video is about mosiquitoes and although Umang Mishra in the "Makers" does not appear in the 1min 8sec film, he appears in the later part of the full 5 mins video. 
The video length has been decreased to match the length of the rest of other classmate's video.

I have initially made a design of the website on Figma. 
The link for the design is :https://www.figma.com/file/1f7Ju6LHSR8kbxJLyr8iPy/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

Font that I used is Scream Real, which has been made for the movie Scream 1996.
The reason for this is that while designing the logo for my project, the 'M' of the font seemed suitable for the first letter of Mosquito.

Point color that are used are #FF1102, #FF5D02. These are used for logo and the headings. The colors were inspired from Saul Bass's movie posters.
Background colors used are #373934 and #202020.

The poster image was inspired my movie posters.

The layout of the website was inspired by movie advertising websites in the late 2000's and early 2010's. I thought this layout was suitable for showcasing a movie or a film to create an overall exitement of the film before watching it.

HTML and CSS were used to make the basic design of the website.
Flexbox was used to make the website layout stay aligned no matter the size of the window. 
For the Makers section of the website, a condition was made to make the layout vertical depending on the screen size.

Java script has been used for the "Go to Top" button.

User interactivity was made through the changing colors of the navigation bar and the "Gp to Top" button.


Please enjoy :)
